## Movies Library

Hi, This is a Small **Angular 16** Project about **Personal Movie Library**. The App has Features like Adding a new movie, Updating existing movies,etc.
The Application has CRUD Operations fully functional.

## Live Demo

The Application is Deployed and live on **Netlify** at the following URL - *https://movie-library-kausthub.netlify.app*

Please Note:-
 - The Api used in the application is also developed by me (**Node.js Project**). *(https://github.com/kausthubmayuram/movies-api)*
 - The Api is Hosted on a Free Server which goes to sleep after inactivity, hence when using the application there might be cases/times when the api might take time.
 
## Install and Locally Running
Clone the Repository at desired location
Then

    npm install
   
   After installing dependencies to run the application

    npm start
    
   Visit `http://localhost:4200`.
